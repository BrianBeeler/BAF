Assignment Notes:
It is a simple design for Industry, based on the Light section
Images and headings are centered, it is somewhat responsive in that they get smaller with screen width
The main menu is not completely responsive, since this was already working on the original site I did not 
make it the focus of this project. 
This site uses links to the actual Big Ass Fans site
TO DO: Add dropdown menu to 'support' and 'company', added footer material as in regular site

I'm happy to discuss next steps, how and why I chose the stack, and anything else you want to ask about the project.
